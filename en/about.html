<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This project aims at developing an intelligent agent able to translate a signal language to a 
speech-written language in real time. We hope this project approximates deaf communities to communities 
that do not speak a signal language.</p>

<h1>Translation Approach</h1>

<p>A signal language can be split into five parameters: hand gestures, orientation, articulation point, move, and 
facial or body expression. Each parameter is responsible for a signal mean element, like punctuation and intensity. We 
are employing Deep Learning, Parallel Processing with GPUs, Big Data, Software Engineering, and Linguistics in order to 
reach our goal.</p>
